You can produce it by /6/mixing/6/ /b/Paper/b/ with either /b/Synthetic Oil/b/ or /b/Synthetic Rubber/b/. Mix the /b/Coke Dust/b/ you made with /b/Water/b/ in a /b/Mixer/b/ to produce /b/Raw Synthetic Oil/b/. Use a /b/Steam Blast Furnace/b/ to produce these two fluids. /b/Synthetic Rubber/b/ is more difficult to obtain, /6/but will yield more rubber per sheet of paper/6/.",
